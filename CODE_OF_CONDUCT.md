# Code of Conduct for Unfucker Python Package

## Purpose

Listen up, folks! This Code of Conduct lays down the law on what we expect from everyone who dares to participate in this damn community, as well as the shitstorm that will ensue for unacceptable asshattery.

We cordially invite all of you badass coders participating in Unfucker activities to help us not just code well, but also be decent human beings. Capiche?

## Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

Look, another goddamn goal of this Code of Conduct is to boost open-source badassery by encouraging you lovely nerds to recognize the ripple effect of your actions on our kickass community.

## Expected Behavior

-   **Be Respectful**: Show some damn respect and value each other’s ideas, styles, and viewpoints.
-   **Be Direct but Professional**: We're not in kindergarten, act like the grown-ass adults we presume you are.
-   **Be Inclusive**: Don't be a douche. Seek out diverse perspectives. Variety is the spice of life, after all.
-   **Avoid Being a Trolling Moron**: Derailing productive discussions, trolling, and acting like an insufferable twit is just crap behavior, okay?

## Unacceptable Behavior

Here's the shit we won't stand for: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning crap. This covers all the bases—offensive comments related to gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, and so on. If you're planning on being a troll, stalker, or just generally unpleasant, prepare for a world of hurt.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Don't test us. Unacceptable behavior is, you guessed it, unacceptable. If we tell you to knock it off, you better listen, or you'll find yourself banned faster than you can say "Unfucker."

## Reporting
