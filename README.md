1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skullzarmy/unfucker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd unfucker
```

3. Install the package locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

By using pip install -e ., you're performing an "editable" install, which means changes to the source code will immediately affect the installed package without needing a reinstallation.

Now, you can import the package in your Python scripts without having to manipulate your PYTHONPATH.

## Dependencies

The project dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Importing into a Script

To use Unfucker in a Python script, simply import the class and use it as follows:

```python
from Unfucker import Unfucker, unfuck

file_path = "path/to/your/file.json"
output_path = "path/to/save/fixed/file.json"

# Initialize the Unfucker
unfucker = Unfucker(file_path)

# Unfuck the file
fixed_content, error = unfucker.unfuck()

if fixed_content:
    # Save to a file or use fixed_content as you see fit
    unfucker.save_to_file(str(fixed_content), output_path, True)
else:
    print(f"Could not unfuck the file: {error}")
```

### Command-Line Interface

Alternatively, you can run the script from the command line:

```bash
unfucker path/to/your/file.json -o path/to/save/fixed/file.json --overwrite
```

```bash
python path/to/unfucker.py path/to/your/file.json -o path/to/save/fixed/file.json --overwrite
```

-   `path/to/your/file.json` is the path to the file you want to fix.
-   `-o path/to/save/fixed/file.json` specifies where to save the fixed content.
-   `--overwrite` allows you to overwrite the output file if it already exists.

## Running Tests

This project uses pytest for testing. To run the tests locally, you'll need to install pytest if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Once pytest is installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will discover and run all the test cases in the project. If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating the number of passed tests.
